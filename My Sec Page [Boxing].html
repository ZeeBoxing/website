<p>why boxing is the best sport?</p>

<p> i beleive that boxing is the best sport because since i was a kid i was into boxing i used to always watch boxing and learn some of skills and when i used to go traing i used to use all the skills that i learned when i was watching the boxing 
boxing always is a great sport because it keep you healthy and it also helps you lose weight fast if you think that its wont 
help you then go ahead try punching a heaving for secound you will notice how heavy you would start breathing. 
oxing trains cardiovascular strength and endurance more effectively than the majority of the workouts available today. 
It has the power to condition the human body into an energy-efficient machine. 
Take one look at the body of a professional boxer, and youâ€™ll see an incredibly lean and cut athlete that is in prime condition.

The intensive and rigorous pad work exercises in boxing, followed by the constant fast-paced repetition of striking and punching techniques is great in developing enhanced aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
i hope you have found very useful and if there is any problem please email me</p>
