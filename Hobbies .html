<h1 style="color:pink"><i>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>My hobbies are playing football, boxing and swimming
Boxing has many benefits. One of them is losing weight fast and getting lean and fit. 
If you’re looking for the perfect workout to lose weight and get yourself in the best shape of your life, why don’t you give boxing a try?</p>

<p>Playing football increases aerobic capacity and cardiovascular health and improves muscle tone, builds strength, flexibility and endurance. 
The player also benefits greatly from the varied shifts between walking, running and sprinting.
As football is generally not a contact sport, the risk of injury is far lower than team contact sports such as rugby or hockey.
Football teaches its players coordination, teamwork skills, focus, concentration and self-discipline.</p>

<p>Benefits of swimming
being a relaxing and peaceful form of exercise
alleviating stress
improving coordination, balance and posture
improving flexibility
providing good low-impact therapy for some injuries and conditions
providing a pleasant way to cool down on a hot day
being available in many places – you can swim in swimming pools, beaches, lakes, dams and rivers. Make sure that the environment you choose to swim in is safe.
